# 🔥 The Crazy Practice Zone

> **Warning:** You are now entering the wild side of my Java learning journey. Proceed with curiosity!

## What is this folder?

This, my friend, is where the **magic (and chaos)** happened.

Before I got all serious and organized with proper lesson structures in the `src/` folder, I was here — just me, my keyboard, and a whole lot of "let me try this real quick" energy. This is my **raw, unfiltered, handwritten code** — typed with my own fingers, debugged with my own tears, and celebrated with my own fist pumps. 💪

Think of this as the **scratch paper** before the final exam. The **rehearsal** before the concert. The **ugly first pancake** before the perfect stack.

## Why does it look... like this?

Because learning isn't pretty! 😄

I was experimenting, breaking things, fixing things, breaking them again, and somehow learning Java along the way. Every `.java` file here is a little piece of my brain figuring things out in real time.

No fancy project structure. No clean architecture. Just pure, beautiful, messy **practice**.

## What's inside?

| Folder | What I was messing around with |
|--------|-------------------------------|
| `Lesson01_OOP_Fundamentals` | Classes, objects, inheritance — the OOP basics |
| `Lesson02_Collections_And_Generics` | Lists, generics, and "wait, why won't this compile?" |
| `Lesson03_Comparator_And_Sorting` | Sorting stuff and writing comparators like a boss |
| `Lesson04_Collections_Performance` | Figuring out which collection is faster (spoiler: it depends) |
| `Lesson05_Exception_Handling` | Try-catch-finally and praying nothing crashes |
| `Lesson06_Custom_Exceptions` | Making my own exceptions because built-in ones weren't dramatic enough |
| `Lesson07_Custom_Exception_Practice` | More custom exceptions — because practice makes perfect |
| `Lesson08_Multithreading_Basics` | Threads! What could possibly go wrong? (Everything.) |
| `Lesson09_Race_Condition_And_Synchronization` | Learning why threads fight each other and how to stop them |
| `Lesson10_Executor_Service_And_Future` | Executor services — fancy thread management |
| `Lesson11_Lambda_Expressions` | Lambdas — writing less code, feeling like a wizard |
| `Lesson12_Stream_API` | Streams — because for-loops are so last century |
| `Lesson13_Stream_Collectors` | Collecting stream results like Pokémon |

## Should you judge this code?

**Absolutely not.** 😂

This is the "learning in progress" zone. The polished stuff lives in the `src/` folder. This folder is where I earned my battle scars.
